# **How to Create Interactive Covid-19 Map in Python Using Pandas and Plotly**

This notebook was made when Covid-19 was at its critical world issue, where logistic distribution, transportation safety, education, and other sectors were disrupted. 
To support decision-making that considers Covid-19, data representing cases of covid and its location is beneficial. 
A powerful way of visualizing the aforementioned data is by utilizing maps. 
In this case, the code below provides steps to create static and interactive daily time-series map of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death tolls of Covid-19.

# Data
* Daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases are obtained from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

# Tools
Libraries used in this code are:
* Pandas to manipulate create and manipulate dataframe
* Plotly to visualize dataframa
